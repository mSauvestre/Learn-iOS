Learn-iOS
=========

I'm going to list here a list of small projects I intend to develop to learn programming on iOS.

The first projects are going to be very general, to familiarize with Objective-C development and syntax. 

Next projects will most likely be very targeted to some professional needs I might have on the Pinio context, to better prepare the knowledges I will use when developping there.


I'm not even sure I will go beyond the first project, it will highly depend on the time I have, but I will try to keep an updated list of projects prioritized by difficulty.
